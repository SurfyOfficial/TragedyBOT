# TragedyBOT
Tragedy's Official Discord BOT.
It's a BOT that we use for misc stuff and for Guild's porpouses.

## Copyright
I've made this bot with my heart, if you want to use parts of my code, feel free to do so.
BUT you cannot sell anything that you got from here.

```bash
You can't use these code lines and use them in products that you're willing to sell.
You can use them for building your own discord BOTS, as long as they are NON-PROFIT.
You can use my code to learn how to code Discord BOTS in Java!
```

## Installation
In case you want to get this code (lelel skidder) you need:
GitHub, IntelliJ Idea (with: GIT, lombok, dvn8tion)
Open a new project through this repository and you're good to go.

## Contributing
You're more than welcome to suggest me updates!
